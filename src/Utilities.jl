    Reads data within a file with the newline character as delimiter

    Parameters: filename::String - REQUIRED
                type::Any - the type of data - Optional kwargs, Default=Float64

    Return: Vector{type} - the data Vector, where 'type' is chosen by the user

    Performs 1D trapezoidal integration on a discreet function (as a Vector) with respect
    to some corresponding discreet domain (also as a Vector). The resulting Vector contains
    accumulated integration result for each domain step.
        
    Parameters: x::Vector{<:Number} - the discreet domain - REQUIRED
                f::Vector{<:Number} - the discreet function - REQUIRED

    Return: CR::Vector{Number} - cumulative integration result for each domain step

"""
    Finds the sliding medians of a 1D Vector according to window_size. The returned Vector
    is always of the same length as the original. The algorithm uses the nearest valid value
    for edge conditions; this is equivalent to SciPy's median_filter() with mode='nearest'.
    Currently, only this condition is supported, might be extended in the future!
    
    Parameters: samp::Vector{<:Real} - the vector of samples - REQUIRED
                window_size::Int - window size for taking the median - REQUIRED

    Return: filtered::Vector{Real} - the resulting Vector, always of the same length as samp
